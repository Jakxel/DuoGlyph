# DuoGlyph

DuoGlyph is an interactive language-learning application designed to help users **practice and study writing systems** through game-like experiences. The app focuses on symbolic writing systems such as **Japanese Hiragana** and **Korean Hangul**, combining study modes with practice games to reinforce recognition and recall.

## Concept
